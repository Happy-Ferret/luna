## Development

1. clone the repository
2. run `npm install` to install application's dependencies and devDependencies.
3. run `npm run dev`

if you are on linux and get error **gyp WARN EACCES**, run `sudo npm install --allow-root`
maybe you have to delete the node_modules folders first.

## Notes

For the previous version of the application you can use the **UI/bootstrap branch**
You have to remove the node_modules folder and run a clean install then use:

`git checkout UI/bootstrap`

`npm install`

if you encounter permission problems on Linux try:

`sudo npm install --allow-root`
